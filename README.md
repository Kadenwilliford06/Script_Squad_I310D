# How to Run Code
To run the code, you need to download the file titled Main_code.ipyinb and then open it in a Jupyter notebook. After you open the file, you need to run all code blocks in order to ensure that you get the CSV files. After there is a section that says chosen_data = and chosen_metric =. You need to fill in the information that you want for each inside the ''.
